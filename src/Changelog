JG-2006-10-19-0: Enhancem.: Added per host setting of a send speed used by 
                            testsuite to send text to spawned shells.
                            On some operation systems, a user's login shell 
                            (esp. bash) dumps core, when testsuite sends at full
                            speed.

JG-2006-10-13-0: Bugfix:    wait_for_enter silently failed when file permissions
                            were incorrect.
                            This caused testsuite to go into an endless loop, if
                            you didn't have a configuration yet.
