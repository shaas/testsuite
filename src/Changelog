CR-2006-10-30-0: Cleanup:   - sending a CTRL-C in close_spawn_process produces

JG-2006-10-23-0: Enhancem.: Allow to pass the current working directory to 
                            functions 
                            - create_shell_script
                            - open_remote_spawn_process
                            - start_remote_prog

JG-2006-10-19-0: Enhancem.: Added per host setting of a send speed used by 
                            testsuite to send text to spawned shells.
                            On some operation systems, a user's login shell 
                            (esp. bash) dumps core, when testsuite sends at full
                            speed.

JG-2006-10-13-0: Bugfix:    wait_for_enter silently failed when file permissions
                            were incorrect.
                            This caused testsuite to go into an endless loop, if
                            you didn't have a configuration yet.

                            - delete_file failed for file names containing
